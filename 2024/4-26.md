## What I Learned

### Viem

`eth_call` and `eth_sendRawTransaction` are the low level JSON RPC methods used under the hood for contract reads/writes.
`*filter` and `eth_getLogs` are the low level JSON RPC methods used under the hood for listening to events.

Action or method types:

- Public - read methods (getBalance, getChainId, etc)
- Wallet - can perform writes and deploy contracts
- Test

**Client**

The client is how we can interact with an EVM node to do things like get a wallet's balance or get the block number.

```ts
const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http(API_URL),
});
```

### Sway

Imports are based on the project source: `use ::math::types::i24::I24` for `src/math/types/i24.sw`

### Misc

Creates a valid private key.

```js
require("crypto").randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
```
